George Brown College

George Brown College is a public college in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It offers a wide range of programs, including business, 
technology, health sciences, and community services. The college has three main campuses: Casa Loma, Waterfront, and St. James.

I myself, am studying in the Casa Loma Campus of George Brown College. This campus offers a variety of programs in the field of 
technology, fashion, etc. 
The campus is full of amenities like quiet places in the library for students to study peacefully, study rooms for groups, unique
seating arrangements all over the campus to do you thing in between classes, a cafeteria for whenever you are hungry and want to grab
a bite before class.
